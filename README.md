# WideTrax
## Description

**widetrax** is a package for manipulating wide-swath altimetry ocean data.
It computes the power spectrum density (PSD) of Sea surface Height (SSH) for both phases/orbits of the SWOT mission.
**widetrax** provides easy-to-use functions that allow users to read SWOT data in both NetCDF and Zarr collections formats, clean and handle NaN values, perform interpolation, and compute the wave spectrum.
